Statement:
Given $Q$ cases. For each case, given integer $a_i$. Please factorize it.


Constraints:
- $1 \leq Q \leq 100$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 1000000000000000000$


Input:
```
$Q$
$a_0$
$a_1$
:
$a_{Q - 1}$
```


Output:
Print $Q$ lines. For each line, print as follows. $k$ is the number of factors and $x_i$ is the factors in __ascending__ order.

Category: Other


Statement:
You are given an integer sequence $A$ with the length $N$. Find a longest increasing subsequence of $A$.


Constraints:
- $1 \leq N \leq 500000$
- $0 \leq A_i \leq 1000000000$


Input:
~~~
$N$
$A_0$ $A_1$ $\dots$ $A_{N - 1}$
~~~


Output:
On line $1$, output the maximum length $K$ of an increasing subsequence of $A$.
On line $2$, Print an increasing subsequence of length $K$. 
$i_k$ is the index of the kth element of the subsequence.
